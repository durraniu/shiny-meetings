## About shiny-meetings

`shiny-meetings` is a social and collaborative shiny app development
project, inspired by the `TidyTuesday` project. Following is the general
workflow:

- Propose a 15-day shiny app project
  [here](https://github.com/durraniu/shiny-meetings/discussions/3)  
- Choose a [TidyTuesday
  dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) if it is a
  data-driven project  
- First 2 days:
  - Brainstorm on the features and do initial wireframing. You may use
    AI tools such as [shiny
    assistant](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/assistant/#) or [ploomber AI
    editor](https://editor.ploomber.io/)  
  - Choose the framework to use: Just shiny, golem, rhino, shiny +
    plumber, shiny + ambiorix + htmx, etc.  
- First meeting to discuss the features and UI  
- Next 5 days: Develop the app. Each participant chooses the stuff to
  work on solo or in a pair. This can be work on theming, layout,
  functions, modules, APIs, database, etc.  
- Next 5 days: Move to a different aspect of development, e.g., if
  previously working on UI, now work on server  
- Collaborate mostly on GitHub. Depending on the type of work, you can
  also do pair-programming e.g., with liveshare in VSCode, etc.  
- Second meeting to discuss the deployment and any development related
  stuff  
- Final 3 days: Deploy. This will likely involve using containers and
  scaling them. golem and rhino will be helpful. Also, faucet.
